# Smart Street Lighting System (ESP32 + PIR + LDR)

This project is a **Smart Street Lighting System** that automatically controls street lights based on ambient light and human movement.  
It uses an **ESP32 microcontroller**, an **LDR** to detect day/night, and a **PIR sensor** to detect motion. At night, the lights remain **dim** to save energy, and when motion is detected, they switch to **full brightness** using PWM control via a MOSFET.  
This system reduces power consumption, enhances safety, and can be scaled for real-world smart city applications.

## üîπ Features
- Automatic **day/night detection** with LDR  
- **Motion-triggered full brightness** using PIR  
- **PWM dimming** for smooth brightness control  
- Energy-efficient and cost-effective  
- Expandable for IoT/remote monitoring

## üîπ Hardware & Software
**Hardware Components**:  
See the complete [Components List](Components%20list/README.md).  

**Software Requirements**:  
- Arduino IDE (with ESP32 board support installed)  
- Required libraries: *(none beyond default Arduino functions)*

## üîπ Working Principle
1. **Daytime** ‚Üí Lights remain **off**.  
2. **Nighttime (LDR detects darkness)** ‚Üí Lights remain at **dim brightness**.  
3. **Motion detected by PIR** ‚Üí Lights turn **full brightness** for a hold time.  
4. **No motion** ‚Üí Lights gradually fade back to **dim mode**.
